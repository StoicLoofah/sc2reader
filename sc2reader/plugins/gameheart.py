    normalize a GameHeart replay to:
    1) reset frames to the game start
    2) remove observing players
    3) fix race selection
    4) fix team selection
    If a replay is not a GameHeart replay, it should be left untouched
    Hopefully, the changes here will also extend to other replays that use
    in-game lobbies

    This makes a few assumptions
